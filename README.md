 is a sophisticated Python3 application designed to search, analyze, and report on bars within a given location. Utilizing the Yelp API for data retrieval and OpenAI for market analysis, BarBeat provides a detailed overview of the bar scene in the specified area, including an analysis of low-rated establishments and suggestions for improvements.
</p>

  <strong>Overview</strong><br>
  <strong>Features</strong><br>
  - Search Functionality: Leverage the Yelp API to search for bars based on user-provided locations.<br>
  - Market Analysis: Analyze low-rated bars, providing a detailed report and actionable suggestions for enhancements.<br>
  - Detailed Reporting: Generate an HTML file containing comprehensive information about the bars, including ratings, addresses, contact details, pricing, and categories.<br>
  <strong>Requirements</strong><br>
  - Python 3.x<br>
  - Libraries: <code>requests</code>, <code>json</code>, <code>os</code>, <code>statistics</code>, <code>openai</code><br>

  <strong>Requirements</string> 

  Python 3.x: The tool is written in Python 3, so a compatible version of Python must be installed.

<strong>Library Requirements</strong>
  requests: For making HTTP requests to the Yelp API.
  json: For handling JSON data.
  os: For interacting with the operating system.
  statistics: Although imported in the code, it doesn't seem to be used, so it might not be a necessary requirement.
  openai: For interacting with OpenAI's GPT-3 model.

<strong>API Keys</strong>
    Yelp API Key: Required for fetching data about bars in the specified location.
    OpenAI API Key: Required for analyzing market competition among bars.

<p align="center">These requirements must be met to successfully run and utilize the BarBeat tool.</p>

  <strong>Installation and Setup</strong><br>
  1. Clone the Repository: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:<br>
  <code>git clone https://github.com/tukru/BarBeat</code><br>
  2. Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and use the following command to install the required libraries:<br>
  <code>pip install requests openai</code><br>
  3. API Keys Configuration: You will need to obtain API keys for Yelp and OpenAI. Follow the steps below to retrieve the keys:<br>
  - Yelp API Key:<br>
    - Visit Yelp Developers and create an account or log in.<br>
    - Create a new App and obtain the API key.<br>
    - Replace api_key variable in the script with your Yelp API key.<br>
  - OpenAI API Key:<br>
    - Visit OpenAI and create an account or log in.<br>
    - Navigate to the API keys section and obtain the key.<br>
    - Replace openai.api_key variable in the script with your OpenAI API key.<br>
  4. Execute the Script: Run the script using the command:<br>
  <code>python3 barbeat.py</code><br>
  5. Provide Location: Enter the desired zip code or address to initiate the search for bars.<br>
  6. View Results: Upon successful execution, the analysis will be saved to <code>html/bars.html</code>.<br>


  <strong>How It Works</strong><br>
  - Search Bars: The script uses the Yelp API to search for bars in the specified location.<br>
  - Analyze Competition: It analyzes the competition among low-rated bars and provides suggestions for improvements using OpenAI.<br>
  - Generate Report: The details of the bars, along with the analysis, are saved in an HTML file.<br>
